2. **Supabase:** Set up Supabase for Authentication and Database functionalities.
3. **Stripe:** Set up Stripe for Subscription payments.

## Upcoming Content

Stay tuned for expansive documentation and a video course covering in-depth details of the project.
This course will be available for a nominal fee, providing you with a comprehensive understanding of
the starter template and how you can maximize its potential.

## Externals Setup

Below are some additional setup tasks that are not directly related to code:

- **Environment Variables:** Create a .env file from the .env_example. This file is for development
  convenience, is .gitignored by default, and should not be added to source control.
- **Supabase:** Follow the instructions to set up Supabase, an essential part of this solution for
  Auth and DB management.
- **Stripe:** Stripe is used for Subscription payments. You will need to set up your Stripe business
  and create products ('Team Plan' and 'Individual Plan') each with a single price.

## Database Setup

Please note that there might be additional setup tasks for the database using Supabase.

## Development Setup

Install dependencies using your preferred package manager:

```bash
npm install
```

## Starting the Development Server

You can start the development server on `http://localhost:3000` with the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Building for Production

To build the application for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Previewing the Production Build

You can preview the production build locally with:

## Deployment to Vercel

The deployment process is entirely in your hands, but we recommend Vercel due to its ease of use and
compatibility with Nuxt.js. Below are some general steps to deploy your application to Vercel:

- Sign up or log in to Vercel using your GitHub account.
- Create a new project and import from your repository.
- Configure the environment variables as per your `.env_example` file.
- Vercel will automatically detect the Nuxt app and select appropriate settings.
- Apply a custom domain name, if required.

Remember to also update your Supabase configuration to reflect your new Vercel URL.
