Welcome, brave coder, to the frontline of our mission to conquer the internet - one pixel at a time.
Our task today is to test your mettle in the fire of front-end development. Do not fear, this isn't
one of those mind-numbing whiteboard tests where you have to reverse a binary tree while standing on
your head. Our aim is a tad more practical and a smidge less torturous.

Here's what we're eager to discover:

1. **Problem-solving:** Can you unravel a problem like a basket of yarn? Or, at the very least, not
   get too tangled in it?
2. **Code quality:** Will your code look like an abstract painting or a well-crafted sonnet? Hint:
   We're poetry fans.
3. **Communication:** Will we vibe like rock band or clash like cats in a bag? Let's find out!
4. **Technical knowledge:** Do you have the technical know-how to wield Vue/Nuxt or React/Next like
   a Jedi knight wields a lightsaber?
5. **Design Implementation:** Can you turn a wireframe into a symphony of pixels that will make our
   eyes weep with joy?

During this interview, you will have the chance to display your skills in a more "work-like"
environment. You're free to use any resources, tools, and even perform a quick Google search, just
like in your day-to-day work. I'll be here, not as a stern examiner, but more like a friendly tour
guide through our discussion.

Just keep in mind:

- **This isn't the SATs.** We aren't looking for the "perfect" solution - we're interested in your
  journey to a solution.
- **This isn't Jeopardy.** If you don't know something, don't fret. Ask!
- **This is your stage.** Let us into your thought process, let us hear the gears turn and see how
  your mind tackles the tasks.
- **This isn't a sprint.** We care more about how you approach the tasks than if you finish them.
- **These are our tools.** Our tech stack includes Vue/Nuxt 3, TailwindCSS, Pinia, Vite, Vitest, and
  Zod. If you know any of these, awesome! If not, no biggie, we're still cool.

Let's dive in:

**1. Opening Act (10 minutes):**

- Meet and greet, chit-chat, introductions - the usual networking jazz.
- Let's hear about your front-end adventures so far, and your daring duels with Vue/Nuxt or
  React/Next.

**2. Headliner - Hands-on Pair Coding (60 minutes):**

- This is where you rock the stage. You'll be asked to complete a simple task, and if you're up for
  it, a more complex one. If there's still time to burn, we could chat about how you'd implement the
  "Bonus" tasks, or you can wow us by actually doing it.

Here are some examples of what we might tackle:

**Example 1:**

- **Simple Task (20 minutes):** Create a Vue/React application with a form to add a new "todo" item
  to a list.

- **Complex Task (40 minutes):** Extend the simple task to allow for marking todos as done, deleting
  them, and filtering the view to show all, done, or undone tasks.
  - **Bonus:**
    - Add local storage support to persist todos between browser sessions.
    - Implement a feature to edit existing todos.
    - Add due dates for todos and sort them based on these dates.

**Example 2:**

- **Simple Task (20 minutes):** Create a Vue/React application that fetches data from a public API
  (like a list of users from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users) and displays the data in a
  list on the Home page.

- **Complex Task (40 minutes):** Extend the application by adding functionality for the user to
  select a user from the list and view more details about that user on a separate page.
  - **Bonus:**
    - Add a search bar that allows users to filter the user list in real-time.
    - Implement pagination for the list of users.
    - Save the user's last viewed user and show it when they revisit the application.

**Example 3:**

- **Simple Task (20 minutes):** Create a Vue/React application with a navigation bar and three
  routes/pages - Home, About, and Contact.

- **Complex Task (40 minutes):** Extend the application by fetching some data from a public API and
  displaying it on the Home page. Include a "More Details" button on each item that opens a modal or
  new page with more information when clicked.
  - **Bonus:**
    - Add a feature that allows users to "favorite" items, and show a list of these favorites on a
      separate page.
    - Implement sorting and filtering for the fetched data.
    - Add responsive design to make sure the app looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.

**Example 4:**

- **Simple Task (20 minutes):** Create a Vue/React application that includes a simple form with
  fields for name, email, and message to simulate a contact page.

- **Complex Task (40 minutes):** Expand the application to handle the form submission with
  client-side validation. Show success or error messages to the user depending on whether the
  validation passes or fails.
  - **Bonus:**
    - Implement a "live" form validation that provides user feedback as they type, rather than on
      submission.
    - Add a captcha to the form for extra security.
    - Include other form elements like checkboxes, radio buttons, or select dropdowns, and handle
      their data on form submission.

**Example 5:**

- **Simple Task (20 minutes):** Create a Vue/React application that displays a list of items with
  their names and prices.

- **Complex Task (40 minutes):** Extend the application by adding a shopping cart feature. Users
  should be able to add items to the cart, view the caret with all added items, and see the total
  price of the items in the cart.
  - **Bonus:**
    - Allow users to adjust the quantity of each item in the cart.
    - Implement a feature to remove items from the cart.
    - Add a checkout button that simulates a checkout process by clearing the cart and showing a
      success message.

**Example 6:**

- **Simple Task (20 minutes):** Create a Vue/React application that displays a list of posts fetched
  from a public API like JSONPlaceholder.

- **Complex Task (40 minutes):** Extend the application by adding a feature for users to click on a
  post to view the full details of the post in a separate page.
  - **Bonus:**
    - Implement a feature that allows users to add comments to the posts.
    - Add a feature to filter posts by user.
    - Include a pagination feature to navigate through the list of posts.

**3. After-party - Code Review and Discussion (20 minutes):**

- We'll chat about the code you wrote like two friends discussing the latest blockbuster. Why did
  you make the choices you did? How would you improve it? What if it needed to scale?

**4. Backstage - Best Practices & Performant Applications (20 minutes):**

- Here's where we chat about your take on accessibility, performance optimization, and security.
  Think of it as us comparing notes on our craft.

Remember, this isn't a test - it's an adventure. Let's enjoy the journey!
